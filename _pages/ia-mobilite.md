# Course: Artificial Intelligence & Mobility

Welcome to the page dedicated to the **Artificial Intelligence & Mobility** course taught at ESTACA. This course explores the intersections between artificial intelligence and urban mobility challenges.

## Course Description

This course covers the following topics:

- **Introduction to AI applied to mobility**: Fundamental concepts and applications
- **Mobility data analysis**: Collection, processing, and visualization of data
- **Modeling and prediction of transportation flows**: Machine learning techniques for mobility
- **Practical applications**:
  - Route optimization and intelligent traffic management
  - Smart parking systems (e.g., Gare Ton Char project)
  - Transportation demand prediction
  - Autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems

## Student Projects

### Gare Ton Char - Smart Parking Application

An innovative student project developed as part of this course:

**Gare Ton Char** is a mobile application designed to simplify parking in urban environments. The application uses AI algorithms to:

- Locate available parking spaces in real time
- Predict parking space availability
- Optimize routes to available spaces
- Facilitate parking payment

**Key features**:
- Intuitive user interface
- Precise geolocation system
- Integrated secure payment
- Parking history

**Technologies used**:
- Mobile development (React Native/Flutter)
- Machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Integration with payment systems
- Mapping APIs
